We would like to invite men who have engaged with and visited full-service sex workers in England and Wales to participate in this study. We are interested in their involvement in commercial sex markets and their views on prostitution policy and legislation.

Traditionally, male clients have been absent from sex work policy, and this study will be an opportunity to hear their opinion about policies that directly affect them. The aim of this research is to explore how men who engage with and visit service providers in England and Wales perceive law enforcement risks associated with it, and how changes in prostitution legislation may impact on their willingness to visit sex workers. The purpose of this study is to generate a new and original body of information about clients’ participation in commercial sex, contribute to the ongoing policy debate on criminalisation, and also help remove some of the negative stereotypes surrounding those associated with the industry.

If you decide to take part, you will be given a participant information sheet to keep and will be asked to sign a consent form to confirm your agreement to participate. Questions will be shared with you in advance and you will be able to choose whether you prefer to do the interview face-to-face, or voice or text only (on WhatsApp, Telegram, or Twitter/X). Data will be anonymised and kept strictly confidential. You will also be compensated with a £20 retail voucher for your time. Please note that you must be 18 or older to participate. If you would like more information, do not hesitate to contact us.

This study was reviewed and given a favourable ethical opinion by the University of Surrey Ethics Committee. Ref: FASS 21-22 114 EGA.
