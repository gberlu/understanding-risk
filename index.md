title: "Understanding Risk in Commercial Sex Markets"

---

This project explores how men who engage with and visit full-service sex workers in England and Wales understand and perceive law enforcement risks associated with it, and how changes in legislation may impact on their willingness to visit service providers.

The project is funded by the British Academy/Leverhulme Trust Small Research Grants scheme, and it is led by [Dr Giulia Berlusconi](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/giulia-berlusconi) and [Dr Luca Giommoni](https://profiles.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/giommonil).
